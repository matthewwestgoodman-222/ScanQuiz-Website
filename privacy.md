# Privacy Policy
**Effective date:** September 27, 2025

**ScanQuiz: Scan & Quiz** (“the App”, “we”, “our”) respects your privacy.

## What we collect
- **No account data.** We don’t require you to create an account and we don’t collect names, emails, or other personal identifiers.
- **No tracking/analytics.** We do not use third-party analytics or advertising SDKs.

## Your content
- **On-device scanning.** Page scanning/OCR is performed on your device.
- **Question generation.** When you ask the App to generate quiz questions, the text you scanned (or portions/chunks of it) is sent securely to our AI question-generation provider to fulfill your request. We do not send images or personal identifiers.
- **Storage.** Scanned text, chapters, books, and generated quizzes are stored locally on your device. You can delete them at any time from within the App.

## Purchases
- **Subscriptions and payments** are processed by Apple. We don’t receive or store your payment information.

## Children
The App is general-audience software and is not directed to children under 13. If you are under the age required in your country, use the App only with a parent/guardian.

## Data security
We use industry-standard TLS to transmit data to our AI provider when you generate questions. We aim to minimize what is transmitted (text only, no images).

## Your choices
- Don’t start question generation if you don’t want text sent to our AI provider.
- Delete chapters/books/quizzes in the App to remove local copies.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date.
